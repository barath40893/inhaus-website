The AI engineer successfully built a pixel-perfect, multi-page InHaus website, initially cloning kiot.io with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The process began with frontend mock-up, followed by backend integration for a contact form. Initial user feedback led to a shift from B2B to B2C content and an iterative refinement of the color scheme and logo visibility. A major design overhaul was requested, transforming the site into a premium, futuristic aesthetic with advanced UI elements. Technical challenges included recurring  errors and broken component imports/references, which were meticulously debugged. Essential pages like Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Product Detail, and Checkout, along with a Cart Context, were then implemented, integrating the Add to Cart functionality. The site now features a clean, professional design, correct B2C messaging, and all specified pages and core e-commerce flow, with backend APIs for contact and cart operations.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to create a pixel-perfect clone of kiot.io, adapting it with InHaus branding. Initial requirements included replicating design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and responsive behavior, ensuring all interactive elements mirrored the original. This involved building all pages and integrating a full backend immediately.

Over the course of development, specific refinements and additions were requested:
- **Logo Integration**: Incorporate an InHaus logo (initially a color version, later a grayscale) and ensure its visibility.
- **Content Shift**: Transition all website content from a B2B white-label focus to a B2C smart home solutions for end customers narrative.
- **Design Enhancement**: Evolve the website's aesthetic from simple to premium and futuristic, incorporating modern animations, glass morphism, advanced gradients, and high-quality images. Later refined to a clean, professional look.
- **Page Additions**:
    - Privacy Policy page (content from kiot.io).
    - Terms & Conditions page (content from kiot.io).
- **E-commerce Functionality**:
    - Product Detail pages, inspired by obenindia.com, showcasing product images, specifications, and an Add to Cart button.
    - The Add to Cart button must redirect directly to a functional Checkout page.
    - A shopping cart and checkout flow.
