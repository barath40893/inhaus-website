The trajectory documents the evolution of the InHaus smart home e-commerce website. The initial work involved cosmetic and content updates, such as changing contact information and improving logo visibility. A major focus was on reorganizing the homepage layout, which included adding a Packages section and moving it below the hero section to highlight affordability.

Subsequently, a series of feature enhancements and bug fixes were implemented based on user requests. This included adding letter spacing to a heading, fixing cropped product images by changing CSS from  to , and branding updates like changing the browser tab title and implementing a custom favicon. A significant feature was the creation of a comprehensive admin system to manage contact form submissions. This involved creating a backend endpoint to store submissions in MongoDB, sending email notifications to the admin, and building a secure frontend admin dashboard with login, filtering, and data export capabilities.

More recently, the focus shifted to improving user experience with animations. A welcome screen animation was created using , and various scroll-triggered and loading animations were added to the homepage and product pages. The final user request pivots from integrating a pre-existing billing application to developing a brand-new quotation generation app, based on PDF examples provided by the user. The last action was the user uploading these PDFs to define the new requirements.

<pending_tasks>
- Develop a quotation generation application based on user-provided PDF examples.
- The app should generate professional quotes for customers.
- It must also calculate and display the internal cost to company separately from the customer price.
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
The most recent task assigned by the user is to develop a quotation generation application. This request supersedes the previous task of integrating a billing application from a GitHub repository.

The user has provided two PDF files as examples:
1.  
2.  

The explicit instruction is to gather the requirements from these documents to build an application capable of generating premium quotes for InHaus customers, which should also facilitate separate calculations for cost to company and cost to customer.

The work is currently in the initial requirements gathering phase. The AI engineer was about to start analyzing the content and structure of these PDF files to define the features, data models, and UI/UX for the new quotation app. No code has been written for this feature yet.
</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
Analyze the two provided PDF quotation documents to extract and define the detailed requirements for the new quotation generation application.
